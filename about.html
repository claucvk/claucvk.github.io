            <h4>More About me and this website.</h4>
            <p>I am from Venezuela but I live in France since 2010. In the last 9 years I have been psychologist and I have had the opportunity to learn and work in different areas of psychology. I developed some valuable experiences and knowledges about human behavior, social research and technology, but I always felt that something was missing... This "something" was my creative side and my attraction to visual arts that I had never developed it. Thanks to my Master Dissertaions related to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the child developmental psychology I discovered the field of Human Interaction Computer (HCI) and User Experience Design (UX). Gradually, I began to understand what this field was about and more I got into it more passionate I became about it, because I knew that I had found my dream job. UX Design is a mix of logic, critical thinking, creativity and emotion and for me this is amazing.  </p>
            <p> Today here I am, trained myself, working hard, learning a bunch of new and exciting things, meeting interesting people and embracing a new phase in mi life.</p>
            <p> In this website you are going to find a portafolio of my first works, a blog intended to help people to start up in UX Design and HCI and space that encourage the exchange of ideas, tips, experiences... to improve the UX and HCI practice, enhancing scientific research and practical work in this field.</p>
