            <h4>More About me and this website.</h4>
            <p>I am from Venezuela but I live in France since 2010. In the last 9 years I have been psychologist and I have had the opportunity to learn and work in different areas of psychology. I developed some valuable experiences and knowledges about human behavior, social research and technology, but I always felt that something was missing... This "something" was my creative side and my attraction to visual arts that I had never developed it. Thanks to my Master's Dissertation related to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and child developmental psychology I discovered the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience Design (UX). Gradually, I began to understand what this field was about. The more I got into it the more passionate I became about it. I knew that I had found my dream job. UX Design is a mix of logic, critical thinking, creativity and emotion which I find amazing.  </p>
            <p> Today here I am, as a self taught, working hard, learning a bunch of new and exciting things, meeting interesting people and embracing a new phase in my life.</p>
            <p> In this website you are going to find a portafolio of my work, a blog intended to help people to start up in UX Design and HCI, and a space that encourages the exchange of ideas, tips, experiences... to improve the UX and HCI practice, enhancing scientific research and practical work in this field.</p>
