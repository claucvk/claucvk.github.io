						            <p>I am from Venezuela but I live in France since 2010. In the last 9 years I have been psychologist and I have had the opportunity to learn and work in different areas of psychology. I developed some valuable experiences and knowledges about human behavior, social research and technology, but I always felt that something was missing... This "something" was my creative side and my attraction to visual arts that I had never developed it. Thanks to my Master's Dissertation related to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and child developmental psychology I discovered the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience Design (UX). Gradually, I began to understand what this field was about. The more I got into it the more passionate I became about it. I knew that I had found my dream job. UX Design is a mix of logic, critical thinking, creativity and emotion which I find amazing.  </p>
						            <p> Today here I am, as a self taught, working hard, learning a bunch of new and exciting things, meeting interesting people and embracing a new phase in my life.</p>
						            <p> In this website you are going to find a portafolio of my work, a blog intended to help people to start up in UX Design and HCI, and a space that encourages the exchange of ideas, tips, experiences... to improve the UX and HCI practice, enhancing scientific research and practical work in this field.</p>
									<p>I hope you will find useful or interesting the information in here. If you have any comments, suggestions or just want to talk about any topic don't hesitate to contact me, we can speak in spanish, englhish and french. I would be glad to hear from you. </p>
