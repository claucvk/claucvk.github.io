						            <p>I am from Venezuela and I live in France since 2010. Currently, I'm a UX Researcher & Designer, but in the last 9 years I have been Psychologist. Thanks to my background, I developed some valuable skills about human psychology, social research, technology-design and the interaction between them.
									<br>
										My Masterâ€™s dissertation intertwined the digital world with the child developmental psychology. From the scientific literature I discovered several topics related to Human Computer Interaction and UXD. Gradually, I began to understand what this field was about. The more I got into it the more passionate I became about it. I knew that I had found my dream job. UX Design is a mix of logic, critical thinking, creativity and emotion which I find really AMAZING!  
									</p>
									
						            <p> 
										In order to become a UX specialist I'm learning as a self taught and working hard in some projects. I have met professionals in HCI and UXD, consulted forums or websites, made online courses (Coursera and Interaction Design Foundation) and read several books. 
									</p>
						            <p> In this website you are going to find a growing portafolio of my work and a blog intended to help people to start up in UX Design.</p>
									<p>I hope you will find useful or interesting the information in here. If you have any comments, suggestions or just want to talk about any topic don't hesitate to contact me. </p>
