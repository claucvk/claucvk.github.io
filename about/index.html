									<p>Hi there, I'm a citizen of the world who loves traveling, dancing and visual arts. I'm a transplant from Venezuela, lived in France for 6 years and just moved to Providence.</p>
									<p>My fascination to understand human behavior drove me to become a Psychologist. However, during my practice, I always felt that something was missing... This "something" was my interest for technology.</p>
									<p>I attended a Providence Hackathon in November 2016 and it changed my life. I thought I would not be capable of coding, but I met some developers who encouraged me to try it and I found that I love it!
								</p>
								<p>Since then, I have worked in the development of some web applications. Through those experiences, I learned how to apply and combine UX principles with programming skills and reinforced the ability to perceive and be empathic towards human nature to develop effective programs. </p>
								<p>Currently, I am looking for a job as a Web Developer. I would like to work in a company where I can continue to grow up as professional and contribute with my diverse skills to the team. If you're interested in working together or want to talk about Programming, please  <a href="/contact/" class="btn btn-theme">contact me.</a> I'll be happy to hear from you!</p>
