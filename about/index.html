									<h2>Claudia Vargas</h2>
										<p>Software Developer with experience in UX</p>

									<p>Hi there, I'm a citizen of the world who loves traveling, dancing, and enjoys outdoor activities. I have had the opportunity to spend my life in Venezuela, France, and currently in the USA. It has been an enriching experience to meet interesting people from different backgrounds and be exposed to other cultures, languages, and geographical areas.</p>
									<p>My professional journey started with Psychology, understanding human behavior was and still is one of my passion. 
									</p>
									<p>	
									In France, thanks to my Masterâ€™s dissertation I discovered Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and User Experience (UX). This fueled my curiosity about technology and motivated me to learn UX and undertake an internship. Through these experiences, I realized that I can use my knowledge about Psychology to propose designs that respect the limitations and strengths of human beings, by translating user's needs into insightful solutions.
									</p>
									<p>
									When I moved to the USA, I attended to a Hackathon at Providence in November 2016. This literally changed my life. I thought I would not be capable of coding, but I met some developers who encouraged me to try it. After doing some free courses about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, turns out that I love it!

								<p>When I moved to the USA, I attended to a Hackathon at Providence in November 2016. This opened me the doors to coding.</p>
								<p>I thought I would not be capable of coding, but I met some developers who encouraged me to try it. I took HTML, CSS, JavaScript classes and studied as a self-taught. The more I got into it the more passionate I became about it. This allowed me to discover my adaptability to learn about new subjects, and especially to confirm my desire to become a Web Developer. Therefore, I enrolled in the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly to pursue this goal.</p>
								<p>After 5 months of hard and continuous work, learning technical skills, working on my portfolio and resume, writing cover letters and sending job applications, I found my first programming job! </p>
								<p>Currently, I am looking for a job as a Software Developer. I would like to work in a company where I can continue to grow up as professional and contribute with my diverse skills to the team. If you're interested in working together or want to talk about Programming, please  <a href="/contact/" class="btn btn-theme">contact me.</a> I'll be happy to hear from you!</p>
