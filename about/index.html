									<br>
									<p>
										Hi there, I'm a citizen of the world who loves traveling, dancing and visual arts. I'm a transplant from Venezuela, lived in France for 6 years and just moved to Providence.
									</p>
									<p>
										 My background is in Developmental Psychology and I have some experience in UX. I have always been curious about coding and tech in general. I attended a Providence Hackathon in November 2016 and it changed my life. I thought I would not be capable of coding, but I met some developers who encouraged me to try it and I found that I love it!
									</p>
									<p>
										Today here I am, as a Web Developer, looking for a job, working hard every day, learning a bunch of new and exciting programming skills, meeting interesting people and embracing a new phase in my life.
									</p>
						      <p>
										If you're interested in working together or want to talk about Programming, please  <a href="/contact/" class="btn btn-theme">contact me!</a> I'll be happy to hear from you.
									</p>
