					<p>When I participate in the design of a website I try to keep the balance between the users’ needs and the enterprise’s objectives to reach a product of good quality. It means that my designs are based not only on good principles of aesthetics and functionality aspects, but also in a solid strategy that standout your product or service.</p>
