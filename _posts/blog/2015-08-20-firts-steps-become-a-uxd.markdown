<b> If you are reading this is because you are interested in UX Design. </b> I'm not a super star in this field, but I think that my personal experience could give you some clues to become a UX designer. My background is in Psychology, one of the disciplines that is part of UX, but this article is intended for anyone (no matter his background) who wants to jump in. What I propose in here is how to achieve it being self-taught. <!--more-->
	
<b>The principal tools that you are going to need are:</b> a computer, internet access, some free time and high doses of curiosity and motivation.

####Some advices to start up: 
It is not a recipe or the only way to make it. Feel free to do what works and fits the best for you. This worked for me, I hope it will help you too.

* <b>Before to learn technical stuff you need to be clear about your goals and motivations</b>. Ask yourself: Do you understand what is to be a UX designer? Do you really like it? What do you expect from this? How do you feel about it? To answer theses questions you could read some blogs, books and articles. Meet some professionals in this field (online and in physical), talk about their responsabilities, tasks, salary, likes and dislikes. If after this insight you get more excited about it, try to make some practical exercise to get an idea on what's like (e.g. create or modify a digital image, ask opinions about a website project that you want to make, look at websites and write some conclusions about it, etc.). 
  
 * <b>Make a real engagement to learn and work hard</b>.  It is easier to learn if we have a strong motivation and a positive attitude. The process of learning sometimes could be hard, maybe frustrating and it takes time, but is possible to make it. It all depends on your determination, persistence and smart moves, as everything in life. I did know zero in programming or design, all I knew was about Organizational and Child Psychology. I thought it was difficult or impossible to venture in a new profession and today I'm making things that I never thought I would be capable of. This means that is 100% possible to become a UX designer or achieve anything in your life, and it is just matter of believing in yourself, being clear and passionate about the fulfillment of your goals.
 
 * Now that you have an idea what is UX design and your goals and motivations are clear. **Do research and read some fundamental books**. After consulting some UX groups, professionals and articles I decided to read 4 books that helped me to understand the process of UX Design: 1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Don't Make Me Think:</a> this is a book that every UX designer is going to recommend you, because it contains the principles of a good website.  2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-User-Experience-User-Centered-Design/dp/0321683684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440073584&sr=8-1&keywords=ux+jesse+james">The Elements of User Experience:</a> it gives you 5 stages to carry on the design of a product. 3)  <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Design-dexp%C3%A9rience-utilisateur-Principes-m%C3%A9thodes/dp/2212141769/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440073859&sr=8-1&keywords=Design+d%27exp%C3%A9rience+utilisateur%3A+Principes+et+m%C3%A9thodes+UX
">Design d'exp√©rience utilisateur:</a> this book is written in french (I think there isn't an english version), but if you could read it, you can find a substantial summary of methods and design processes.  4) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Guide-Design-experience-designers/dp/0321815386/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433811751&sr=8-1&keywords=project+guide+to+UX
">A Project Guide to UX Design:</a> this book offers a good structure to propose a project to clients. <br> I complemented these readings watching some videos on internet (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y5uPRfXdKY">Harvard i-lab | Fundamentals of Experience Design with C. Todd Lombardo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkUwbPdyMIY">Harvard i-lab | UX Design: An Introduction with Scout Stevenson</a>) and following some online tutorials (e.g. <a href="http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals">UX Crash Course</a>). <i>Research always has to be an important part of the learning process. Even if you become an expert you must continue learning and be updated on the latest tendencies in UX design.<i>

* <b>Do some practical work</b>. Learn how to use tools for programming websites (e.g.: HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.), making mockups  and wireframe (e.g. Balsamiq Mockups, Axure, etc.), user resarch (interviews, observation, etc.), creating and transform images, videos, texts (Photoshop, Illustrator, Gimp, Inkscape, etc.). Apply all that you have learned doing works for friends, projects on your own, family, do some interships and look for groups of work where you can collaborate. On internet you can find a lot of tutorials and books, (free and paid) to learn how to use these tools. In my case I am learning HTML using the book <a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfwd/">Head First Web Design</a>, User Research <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Observing-User-Experience-Second-Edition/dp/0123848695">Observing the User Experience</a>. Regarding others tools, I look for information on different sources from the internet. <i>For this field of work it is very important to have a theoretical and practical training</i>.

* <b> Make a social network and a portfolio to show your work</b>. You must have a presence on internet. For future customers it is important to know and trust that you are capable of doing a good job, and the best way is giving to them evidence of your work. To accomplish this, create a personal website with a portfolio, show who you are, what are yours skills, your interests, recommendations of satisfied clients... In other words try to sell yourself as a good professional and actually look for being one of the bests. Additionally, participate in local reunions, workshops or conferences is a good way to make you known in your own location and find a job.

* <b> Choose your hat.</b> UX design is a multidisciplinary profession (visual design, human factors, computer science...) and you can choose in what you would like to specialize. It is true that is more likely to get hired if you can do more tasks, because it is cheaper for an enterprise to have an employee with several skills than several employees to do the same work (this is true mostly in small and medium sized companies). Although, I think naturally you are going to get more specialized in some disciplines than others, either by your own decision or the job that you have got.

I hope this article would be of help you for you. Checkout this document written by Nielsen Norman Group <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/user-experience-careers/">"User Experience Careers"</a>. It is a report that analyzes how UX professionals educated and trained themselves for their careers.
