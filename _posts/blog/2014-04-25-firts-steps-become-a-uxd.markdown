<b> If you are reading this is because you are interested in UX Design. </b> I'm not a super star in this field, but I think that my personal experience could give you some clues to become a UX designer. My background is in Psychology, one of the discipline that is part of UX, but this article is intended for anyone (no matters his background) who wants to jump in. What I propose in here is how to achieve it being self-taught. <!--more-->
	
The principal tools that you are going to need are : a computer, internet access, some free time and high doses of curiosity and motivation.

####Following there are some advices to start up: 
It is not a recipe or the only way to makes it. Feel free to do what works and fits the best for you. This worked for me, I hope it will help you too.

* <b>Before to learn technical stuffs you need to be clear about your goals and motivations.<b> Ask yourself: Do you understand what is to be a UX designer? Do you really like it? What do you expect from this? How do you feel about it? To answer theses questions you could read some blogs, books, articles. Meet some professionals in this field (online and in physical), talk about theirs responsabilities, tasks, salary, likes and dislikes. If after this insight you get more excited about it, try to make some practical exercise to get an idea what's like (Ex: create or modify an digital image, ask opinions about a website project that you want to make, look websites and write somes conclusions about it, etc.). 
  
 * <b>Make a real engagement to learn and work hard.<b> It is easier to learn if we have a strong motivation and a positive attitude. The process of learning sometimes could be hard, maybe frustrating and it takes time, but is possible to make it. It all depends on your determination, persistence and smart moves, as everything in life. I did know zero in programming or design, all I knew was about Organizational and Child Psychology. I thought it was difficult or impossible to venture in a new profession and today I'm making things that I never think to be capable of. In conclusion, it is 100% possible to become a UX designer or achieve anything in your life, is just matters of believing in yourself and being clear and passioned about the fulfillment of your goals.
