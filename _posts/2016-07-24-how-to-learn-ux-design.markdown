<b> One of the questions that I asked myself when I decided to be a UX Designer was: How to learn it in a fast and effective way?. <!--more-->

* The first thing that I faced was to understand: what was really about UX Design?. So, I started to look for videos on internet, read blogs and asked in specialized forums about books that were important to read. But sometimes, I felt that it didn’t work because UX is a complex field that has different disciplines. I felt that books didn’t explain clearly what was UX Design about. There were so many elements and aspects, but not a central idea that could conduct me to the understanding.

* Then, I started to read the job’s descriptions and this was worse, because it made me feel more confused. Sometimes the job offers showed a mixed profile between visual design + developer + user research. Also, it was scary because they demanded  knowledge on some software that I didn’t know and their name looked fancy and difficult to learn.

* As a result, I understood that I had to learn about web design and web development. So, I started to learn HTML and CSS. I looked for some information about web design. My husband recommended me to use Jekyll and Git to build websites and I created some. Then, delving into my reading I realized that this wasn’t the goal of a UX Designer either.

* I found the key words “Human Factors” and “Ergonomics” and I said: "this is what I need to learn to become a UX Designer!". I read some books and there were some terminologies and methods that I found complicated to understand and boring. So, I got a little sad, but I continued my research of information. I felt that I had a lot information but not a clear path to follow for making me understand what I needed to get a job related to UX Designer.

* I wanted to take an effective training course on internet, that didn’t take so much time and that wasn’t very expensive. I was very reluctant to do that, but I had to make a decision and invest some money. After reading online reviews, and asking to some professionals about it, I found that the more popular courses were **Coursera** and **Interaction Foundation**. I decided to do both. This gave me the clear path that I needed it. I succeeded to have a point of reference in all this information that I had accumulated.

* I completed my learning process with extensive reading and watching videos on internet that summarized or synthetized the information that I got in the courses and the books. I took notes as schemes in order to have a guide and a quick access to this information that I needed it to start doing real work. I collaborated on some little projects of friends, family and my own to practice these new acquired skills.

* After that, I felt  I was ready to look for an internship to have an experience in a real enterprise. I started to look for enterprises specialized in UX Design Consulting in my city. There was one that its style, philosophy and works caught my attention. I made a spontaneous application by email and they answered me that they didn’t need extra staff for the moments. I was a little disappointed and after some days of reflection I decided to write them again. I asked them for an interview to talk about UX Design practices and get their point of view as a UX professional. 

* After some days I received an email that they were reconsidering to accept me as an intern in their enterprise. We had an interview and everything went well. Finally, I got 4 months internship!.

* How the internship went and what I learned I will tell you in a next post, so see you soon!
