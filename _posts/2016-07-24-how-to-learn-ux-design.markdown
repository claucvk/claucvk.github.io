<b> One the question that I ask myself when I decided to be a UX Designer was: How to learn it in a fast and effective way?. <!--more-->

*The first thing that I faced was to understand what was really about UX Design? So, I started to look for videos on internet, read blogs and asked in specialized forum about books that were important to read. But sometimes I felt that it didn’t work because UX is a complex field that has different disciplines and I felt the books that I read didn’t explain clearly what was UX Design about. There were so many elements and aspects, but not a central idea that could conduct me to the understanding.

*Then, I started to read the job’s description and this was worse, because it made feel more confused. Sometimes the job’s offers showed a mixed profile between visual design + developer + user research. Also, it was scary because they demanded the knowledge of some software that I didn’t know and their name looked fancy and difficult to learn.

*As a result, I understood that I have to learn about web design and development. So, I started to learn HTML and CSS and I looked for some information about web design. My husband recommended me to use Jekyll and Git to build websites and I created some. Then, delving into my reading I realized that this wasn’t the goal of a UX Designer neither.

*I found the key words “Human Factors” and “Ergonomic” and I said: that is what I need to learn to become a UX Designer! I read some books and there were some terminologies and methods that I found complicated to understand and boring. So, I got a little sad, but I continued my research of information. I felt that I had a lot information but not a clear path to follow for making me understand what I needed to get a job related to UX Designer.

*I wanted to make a course training effective that were on internet, didn’t take so much time and wasn’t very expensive. I was very reluctant to do that, but I had to make a decision and invest some money. After read online reviewing and ask to some professional about it, I found that the more popular courses were Coursera and Interaction Foundation. I decided to do both. This gave me the clear path that I need it, I succeed to have a point of reference in all this information that I have accumulated.

*I complete my learning process with extensive reading and looking videos on internet that resume or synthetized the information that I got in the courses and the books. I took notes as schemes in order to have a guide and a quick access to this information that I need it to start do real work. I collaborated on some of little projects of friends family and my own to practice these new skills that I got.

*After that I felt that I was ready to look for an internship and have an experience in a real enterprise. I started to look enterprises specialized in UX Design Consulting in my city. There was one that its style, philosophy and works caught my attention. I made a spontaneous application by email and they answered me that they didn’t need extra staff for the moment. I was a little disappointed and after some days of reflection I decided to write them again to ask them an interview to talk about UX Design practice and get their point of view as a UX professional. I explained them that I was decided to become a UX Designer and talk about their professional experience would be very important to develop my career.

*After some days I received an email that they were reconsidered to accept me as an intern in their enterprise and they were available to answer the questions that I had. We had an interview and everything went well. Finally, I got the internship.

*How the internship went and what I learned I will tell you in a next post, so see you soon!
